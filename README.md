# pymlp
Multi Layer Perceptron Library for python made for fun.<br>
Every layers can connect(feeded) directly to other layers, thus you can freely construct deep neural network models.<br>
But it's kinda mess and buggy, I'll really preciate if you decide contribute anything.<br>
Check out the test.py file to see example of this. Docs file is outdated (Works for mlp_old.py)
